  * revenue dropped by 48.98% between January and February, likely due to seasonality.

  * italy generates almost the same revenue as the UK with fewer stores    expansion there could be beneficial.

  * computers and cameras are the most profitable; other categories may need promotions.









The project was absolutely fantastic, and working with SQL was truly enjoyable. I learned new things about subqueries, expanded my analytical thinking, and applied many of the things I learned in the Google course, most importantly data integrity.
